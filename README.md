# Resume Builder Web Application

A smart and user-friendly web application that helps job seekers create high-quality, ATS-friendly resumes effortlessly. It offers both HTML/CSS and PDF formats, ensuring flexibility and professional presentation.   



# 📌 Introduction.  

In today's competitive job market, crafting a well-structured resume is crucial but often challenging. Many job seekers struggle with formatting, ATS compatibility, and content optimization. Our **Resume Builder Web Application** automates this process, enabling users to generate professional resumes with minimal effort.

This project was developed as part of our semester project, focusing on user convenience, AI-driven text enhancement, and multi-format resume generation.



# ⚙️ How It Works

1️⃣ User Data Collection: The frontend captures essential user details through an interactive form.  

2️⃣ Secure Data Transmission: The collected information is securely sent to the backend using HTTPS.  

3️⃣ Resume Generation: The backend dynamically creates a HTML/CSS-formatted resume based on the provided details.  

4️⃣ PDF Conversion: The HTML resume is converted into a high-quality PDF using WeasyPrint.  

5️⃣ File Packaging & Download: Both the HTML template and PDF file are zipped together and sent to the frontend for easy download.
